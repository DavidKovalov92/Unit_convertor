# Unit converter

This web app I create as my first pet project

measures that the Finn can convert to:
- Length: millimetre, centimetre, metre, kilometre, inch, foot, yard, mile
- Weight: milligram, gram, kilogram, ounce, pound
- Temperature: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin

Also for this project, tests are written, they are located on the path Convert/tests

You can run the project on the local server 127.0.0.1
